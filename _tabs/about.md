Hi, I'm Romain Levifve, a cybersecurity explorer and coding enthusiast. My coding journey is a tapestry woven with diverse projects, from competitive programming solutions to practical bash scripts for my Debian machine.

As a self-hosting advocate, I've orchestrated a unique blend of services on my Odroid board, utilizing Docker for optimized performance. While I primarily engage in backend development, I've integrated applications like Nextcloud and SearX to streamline my personnal online experience.

My GitHub repository mirrors my eclectic coding interests â€” from a Python chatting system to a reinforcement learning project and more. Delving into cybersecurity challenges through platforms like Hack The Box and Root-me, I strive to demystify the complexities of this ever-evolving field.

Beyond coding, I contribute to the cybersecurity community through this blog, sharing insights and tutorials. This space is a testament to my passion for making intricate concepts accessible to others.
